  artifactInfo: Brazilian Grand Prix, 1991
  artifactDescription: "Ayrton Senna\u2019s emotional victory at his home Grand Prix
    remains one of the most legendary moments in Formula 1 history. With just a few
    laps to go, Senna\u2019s McLaren suffered a gearbox failure, leaving him stuck
    in sixth gear. Through sheer determination and skill, he nursed the car to the
    finish line, crossing it in agonizing pain. His screams of victory over the radio
    and the subsequent exhaustion in parc ferm\xE9 symbolize the relentless spirit
    of a champion.\n"
