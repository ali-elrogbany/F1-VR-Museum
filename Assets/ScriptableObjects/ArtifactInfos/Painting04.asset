  artifactDescription: "Considered by many as the greatest lap in F1 history, Ayrton
    Senna\u2019s qualifying performance in Monaco 1988 was a moment of pure transcendence.
    He outqualified his teammate Alain Prost by a staggering 1.4 seconds\u2014an
    unheard-of margin in equal machinery. Senna later admitted he felt as if he was
    driving beyond his own abilities, entering a near-spiritual state of flow. This
    lap remains the ultimate example of F1 drivers pushing the limits of human capability."
