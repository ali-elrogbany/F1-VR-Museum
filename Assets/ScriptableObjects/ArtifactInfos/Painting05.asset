  artifactDescription: "James Hunt\u2019s dramatic World Championship win in torrential
    conditions at Fuji is the stuff of legend. In a rain-soaked, politically charged
    race, Hunt fought his way through the field to secure the points he needed to
    edge out Niki Lauda by a single point in one of F1\u2019s most intense title
    fights. This victory cemented Hunt\u2019s legacy as one of the sport\u2019s most
    charismatic and fearless drivers."
