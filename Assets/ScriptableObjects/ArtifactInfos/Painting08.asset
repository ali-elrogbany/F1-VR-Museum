  artifactName: 'Decided in Controversy: Hamilton vs Verstappen'
  artifactInfo: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, 2021
  artifactDescription: One of the most controversial moments in F1 history. After
    a season-long rivalry filled with drama, Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen entered
    the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix tied on points. In a race that seemed destined for Hamilton,
    a late-race safety car and a controversial decision by race control led to a
    one-lap shootout. Verstappen, on fresher tires, seized the opportunity, overtaking
    Hamilton to claim his first World Championship. A moment that will be debated
    for generations.
