  artifactDescription: "Gilles Villeneuve was a driver who raced with his heart,
    pushing his car beyond its limits with sheer determination and skill. His iconic
    red, white, and blue helmet saw battles that are still spoken of in awe today\u2014whether
    it was his legendary wheel-to-wheel duel with Ren\xE9 Arnoux in Dijon (1979)
    or his heroic drive at Zandvoort on three wheels. This helmet is not just protective
    gear; it is the very essence of passion, risk-taking, and unbreakable spirit
    that made Villeneuve a legend."
